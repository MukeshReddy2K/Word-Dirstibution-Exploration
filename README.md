Using Python and the Natural Language Toolkit 
(NLTK), the document outlines instructions for 
preparing text data and word distribution 
analysis. It describes methods to examine word 
distributions in two different corpora after 
outlining a step-by-step methodology for 
preparing and cleaning text data. Natural 
language processing and text mining 
applications can both benefit from this process, 
which is crucial for understanding text data
